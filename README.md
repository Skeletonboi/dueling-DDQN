# dueling-ddqn
Implementation of dueling double-deep Q learning, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm from scratch. Training is performed in both Atari environments and OpenAI gym environments.

Original goal is to expand upon this algorithm until it reaches the [Rainbow DQN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02298) architecture from DeepMind.
